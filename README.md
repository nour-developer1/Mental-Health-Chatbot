# Mental Health Chatbot using Python  

This project is part of my first assignment as a **Machine Learning Intern at Sync Interns**.  
The chatbot is designed to provide conversational support and resources for individuals experiencing mental health challenges. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to understand user inputs and generate empathetic, non-judgmental responses, fostering a safe space for users to share their thoughts and emotions.  

## Dataset  
The model was trained using the **Mental Health Conversational Data** dataset, which provides diverse conversation samples for building context-aware responses.  

- Dataset: [Mental Health Conversational Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elvis23/mental-health-conversational-data?datasetId=2594075&sortBy=dateRun&tab=collaboration)  

## Development Environment  

**Platform & Tools:**  
- IDE: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)  
- Language: Python  

**Key Libraries & Frameworks:**  
- `numpy` – numerical computations  
- `os` – system operations  
- `pytorch` – deep learning framework  
- `nltk` – natural language processing  
- `json` – data serialization and handling  

## Features  
- Conversational chatbot for mental health support.  
- NLP-driven intent recognition and response generation.  
- Friendly, empathetic conversational flow.  
- Lightweight and extendable architecture for further development.
